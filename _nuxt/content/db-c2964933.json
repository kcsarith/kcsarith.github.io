This service can containers so that can be delivered anywhere with uniform requirements no matter what what our computer environment is like.\n\n### Database\nBefore we created the database, we planned out our models by drawing schemas, and relationships. We also did some brainstorming on how the user can interact with the database to get, post, patch, delete entries and use it to display them on the screen. It's one of the model view controller or view-model method of designing software. Object relational mappings helped us a lot with creating and keeping our database models, migration and seeded organized which made it easier to test out the backend locally or live with ease.\n\n### Middleware\nIt is important to keep our site from thieves forging an authenticated user's request. There were also some problems with cross-origin resource sharing since our front-end and back-end became separate and most browsers have it disabled by default. Fortunately, the way we have our routes organized, we can easily protect them from CSRF attacks and allow CORS by using middleware on our main app file.\n```js\napp.use(cors({ origin: true }));\napp.use(\n  csurf({\n    cookie: {\n      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\",\n      sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\",\n      httpOnly: true,\n    },\n  })\n);\n```\n### Controlling the flow of data\nOur state was managed through a library called Redux which makes state management easier by separating them with actions, reducers and stores. The actions are pure functions that will return the same results if the same parameters are passed in, the reducers if the case matches the action type then does it accordingly, and the store is where the state is well, stored. Redux connect is one of those methods that confused me for a long time but now I know that higher order functions which is a function that returns another function, I just have to learn how to use it properly.\n\nUsing Redux really tests how much I understand about keeping clean, and DRY. I still don't fully understand how to use this technology but I definitely want to learn it more since it would level up my architecting skills.\n\n# Conclusion\nApp Academy knows that building full-stack applications is tough but rewarding. If there is only user auth, and one feature from the MVPs, then that’s how the majority of projects turn out. The styling of the page doesn’t even have to match the original source.

The standups, collaboration, and describing issues is accurate to the work environment at my current developer job.\n<!--more-->\n# Working together\nI've been fortunate to get along with everyone I worked with, but I would also want to see if I could handle someone has a bad attitude, is hostile or lazy. Group learning is one of the best parts about learning at App Academy. It was such a joy working with others at this coding bootcamp, both of the group projects I have done here have everyone pulling their weight. It could just be the nature of App Academy due to their tough selection process. Everyone who joins App Academy wants to learn and work with others since we would do pair programming or group work most of the time. The most hostile we would act towards each other was when we tried to convice each other that the site we picked was the best choice which was all fun and games.\n\nBefore we begin working we start off by selecting a high quality website to clone as a team as it is much better for learning than creating one of our own because. We at least know that the designs and functionality have been tried and tested. The amount of benefits for having good communication within a team is insurmountable. It helps with group cohesion, entice us to meet our goal, debugging, and much more.\n## Splitting up the workload\nApp Academy has found it better for us to get to experience full-stack development, rather than splitting each team member to do a specific thing, just as front-end, back-end or design only. At this stage in our software developer journey, we got to become a balanced engineer to get the big picture, and specialize after getting several years of experience.\n> Do not separate the workload into front-end and back-end! We're full-stack developers, not half stack.\n>- my App Academy instructors, 2020\n\nGitHub was where we did all of our management because of how much tools it had. We would create our wireframes, page design, documentation etc and os them the GitHub wiki. Another useful tool we used was GitHub projects where we could create Kanban boards, create issues and tasks that we could link to pull requests. If there were problems that need to be addressed before a merge, we would fix the code and get it reviewed by our instructors. In our feature packet we have to write out all of our MPVs and get a timeframe of when we are going to complete them. This really made it easier to get our work done on time, and if I was feeling behind, I would finish it up while I was out of class.\n## Communication\nWe would stand-up with our instructors 3 times a day, one at the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end of the day. We would discuss what we have done, what we want to achieve before the end of the day, any blockers preventing me from progressing, and at the end of the day, what we plan to do at night for our project. We also speak amongst ourselves during class and on Slack when we’re not on Zoom.\n\n![What is this communication you speak of](https://media.giphy.com/media/jroWriIlKYSP2tpu20/giphy.gif)\n\n### Communicating built my confidence and skill to estimate my ability\nHaving us state what we have done and our plans for the day, coaxes us to achieve those goals. For the most part, I was able to complete what I said I was going to do because I set my daily goals realistic and achievable. Even procrastinators will do their work when there are goals (deadlines) due soon. If the goals are too far-fetched, I would get into a downward spiral and get the illusion of continually falling behind every second I think about it, getting me to unhealthy work habits, missing sleep, meals, social interactions etc. Keeping my goals reasonable is great for my mental well-being since I get a shot of dopamine for every objective I complete, no matter how small.\n\n## Getting help\nAsking for questions involving bugs is an art in itself and an important communication skill we learned. Programmers don’t just simply ask someone to fix something, code can be resolved quicker if there is a lot of context. I think the process was that we had to describe the problem, find out where this error is happening, what we have tried, and quite possibly, what we think we need to do. If it’s not bug related, we could ask for suggestions without context.\n\nI have also been on the giving side when it comes to helping. I am pretty grateful that I came from a Game Art and Design background because it made it easier for me to design pages. App Academy does not teach us much about the principles of design so almost all of my colleagues would have trouble with making a page look pretty with CSS. They told me that they learned a lot when I was teaching them compared to googling. I would say that we learn well when we communicate with each other, not from lectures or finding the answer through search results.\n\n# Architecture and clean code\nSetting up the project, controlling data flows and keeping code DRY/ clean can speed up the development cycle the larger the project becomes. It's less stressful to just change a variable on one config file than searching for every instance of it and get exposed to code that belongs to someone else that was hardcoded that way for a reason. To keep our secret information hidden such as API keys, tokens, or important info needed for deployment such as URLs, names, ports, etc... we would put but those variables in an env file.\n\nI think making the code elegant and easier to understand increases the longevity of a project.\n\n>You can become a super genius by having a diet of stolen copy-pasta I didn't write and spaghetti in every line of code. My code far is too advanced for your simple brain to wrap your head around it.\n>- says a narcissistic job seeker who failed every tech interview miserably and brags about his 800 line \"Hello World\" console log with 10 async callbacks that he can't even explain or understand for himself.\n![rain man](https://media.giphy.com/media/ohdY5OaQmUmVW/giphy.gif)\n### File structure\nRoutes were organized the same way our file systems or URLs are where we nest folders the deep we go. The first project we created had the back-end and front-end routed on the same server since our project was small and takes less setup to deploy.\n```\n/client\n/config\n/db\n/routes\n\t│\n\t│\n\t└ /api\n\t│\t|\n\t│\t└ /route1.js\n\t│\t└ /route2.js\n\t│\t└ /route3.js\n\t│\n\t└ index.js\n```\n\nAs we moved forward, we haven't went back to putting the front-end and back-end on the same server and have been keeping them separated.

Being a noob, I was very eager to get started working on this project. This was a team project with two other people who also had a beginner level understanding of full-stack development.\n<!--more-->\n\n## What does it use?\nDestructables uses vanilla *JavaScript* to manipulate the document, and *Express.js* as the back end. It also uses *Pug* Templates to render a lot of the *HTML*. Building this project was quite the learning experience and made it quite easy to transition to React.js.\n## MVPs\n- Authentication/ authorization\n- Create, read, update, delete projects\n- Writing comments (my primary role)\n\n## Collaboration\n### Picking a project\nSince this was our first project, and a group one at that, we had shorter lectures so we could document and plan out our project. The website we decided to clone was Instructables, where people share how to create things, but we decided to do the opposite on how to disassemble and call it Destructables.\n\n### Struggling as one\nAll of us were struggling, this is unlike other group projects I've worked on where I'm pulling the weight of all those slacking off, and getting into micro aggressions. We felt on top of the world whenever we make progress but will feel felt imposter syndrome when we weren't. It was easy to get along with each other when when we are all on the same boat.\n\n### It took a while getting used to Git as a team\nUsing GitHub and dealing with merge conflicts was an experience in itself and would sometimes take an entire morning just fixing it. I think we even attempted to collaborate by pasting our code on slack and combining them because it was taking too long for us to fix our Git. It was only after failing dozens of times, until we got better at create branches, and working on separate features. After we learned how to use Git, it became in invaluable tool for us.\n![Two forces collide with subtitles saying Git Merge and chaos ensues](https://media.giphy.com/media/cFkiFMDg3iFoI/giphy.gif)\n### Sharing knowledge\nEven though all of us struggled, it was very crucial for all of us to put our heads together to fit our knowledge gap which was why each of us had front-end and back-end tasks. Authorization/ authentication has been one of my weaknesses and I still struggle with it to this day. I would even say that all three of us don't fully understand auth but still attempted to implement it. Each of us would brainstorm to help us all get on the same page, and we were able to get far until we had some password hashing issues, persistent login, JSON web token which none of us knew how to solve. Our instructors were also there to help us out if we're stuck, and showed all three of us how it was done.\n\nEach of us had our own strengths and weaknesses, I was weaker on the back-end, another weak on the front-end, and one was almost decent at both. My team mates would help me out when I had to work with the database and it was pretty easy to pick up. In turn, I would help them with styling. After we finished helping each other, we would treat each other more with respect.\n\nI talked a bit about collaboration somewhere else on this site. *See the blog I wrote about <a href=\"/blog/building-projects-at-app-academy\" target=\"_blank\">App Academy projects</a> for more detailed info.*\n\n## Directly copying from the source is no good\nYou know that feeling when you discover something you think is a secret and want to exploit it without letting one know? That was how I felt when I started using the Chrome elements inspector and copying the entire page without changing anything.\n\n![shiba typing](https://media.giphy.com/media/1YeNJK6FptDdq1q59K/giphy.gif)\n*Coder copying dom elements and calling it his own.*\n\nBefore I went to App Academy, I actually used to be a script kiddy like this and just flat out use the same code even if I had no clue how it works. Just when people say tutorial hell is a beginner's trap, I think being a code snatcher is even worse. At least doing tutorials will give us some knowledge while taking other people's work, even if it's allowed, just complicates things since I don't understand it. Even though I copied with the intention of saving time, it does the opposite and wastes more time in the long run when problems arise.\n\n> Lesson learned, straight out copying and pasting the entire DOM from the element inspector is not the way to clone a website.\n>- me after I broke out of the habit.\n## Re-using functions to create elements\nIt only took a few hours of failing until I completely got out of the code sniping phase habit. Using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM has been a huge part of our curriculum so far and was easier and more fun to work with. This is a lot cleaner, easier to understand, less lines of code, and easier to manipulate compared to copying an entire page with lots of messy classes, divs, etc.\n```js\nasync function createProjectElements() {\n   projects.forEach(function (project) {\n       const projectDiv = document.createElement('div');\n       const currentTimestamp = Date.now();\n       const projectTimestamp = new Date(project.updatedAt).getTime();\n       const timeAgo = timeDifference(currentTimestamp, projectTimestamp);\n       let projectImage = '/public/images/loginSignup.png';\n\n       projectDiv.classList.add(\"col-lg-3\");\n       projectDiv.id = (`project-container-${project.id}`);\n       if (project.images) {\n           projectImage = `https://destructables-storage-dev.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/${project.images[0]}`\n       }\n       projectDiv.innerHTML = `\n           <div class=\"card mb-2\">\n           <a href=\"/projects/${project.id}\" class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n               <img class=\"card-img-top\" src=\"${projectImage}\" alt=\"Card image cap\">\n           </a>\n           <div class=\"card-body\">\n               <a href=\"/projects/${project.id}\" class=\"card-title font-weight-bold\">${project.name}</a>\n               by ${project.User.username}\n           </div>\n           </div>\n       `\n       containerExploreCategory.append(projectDiv)\n   });\n}\n\n```\n## Async calling and visual re-rendering\nThis is my first full-stack project at App Academy, and I could definitely write more optimized code than I did back then. For instance, for handling this **asynchronous JavaScript and JSON (AJAX)** onClick event, I want to add a new entry to the back-end, as well as re-rendering the entire comment list and reorder them in reverse with the *createComments()* function.\n```js\ndiscussionBoxPostButton.addEventListener('click', async function (e) {\n       const commentText = discusionBoxTextArea.value;\n       if (commentText) {\n           const res = await fetch(\"/api/comments\", {\n               method: \"POST\",\n               headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n               body: JSON.stringify({ comment: commentText, userId: 1, projectId: Number.parseInt(currentRoute) })\n           });\n           if (res.ok) {\n               commentsDisplayContainer.innerHTML = '';\n               comments = await fetchComments(currentRoute);\n               discussionBoxPostButton.disabled = true;\n               numberOfCommentsDisplay.innerHTML = `${comments.length} Discussions`;\n               discusionBoxTextArea.value = '';\n               createCommentElements();\n           }\n           else console.log('failed')\n       }\n}\n```\nI do appreciate that I’m not doing another GET request and this brute force approach is definitely failsafe and easy to imagine. I would probably use *flex-direction: column-reverse* and add one item without re-rendering the whole thing.\n\n## HTML fundamentals aid in learning UI/ UX tech\nNo matter what technology I use, they all seem to use the basic elements that make up an HTML page. Aside from using vanilla JavaScript to create DOM elements, I also used pug to render pages. I don’t even think we had an index.html in this project at all.\n\nNone of us have ever used Pug templates before, but it was so similar to HTML that it was very easy to pick up after googling the things we don’t know.

It was thanks to pop culture and social media that helped me jump into making this transition.\n\n<!--more-->\n## Early influences\n\nEver since I was a child, two of my biggest concerns were solved by just changing my diet. I always questioned the morality of eating meat, and remembered seeing a black and white advertisement on TV showing kid of eating a hotdog. The message was pretty unclear, as I was only in 1st grade, but it definitely made me feel guilty for consuming animal products. There was a huge recycling and environmental craze in the early 90s, global warming was becoming a big deal and heard that more green house gas emissions come from factory farms than vehicles.\n\nThat being said, I was still not a vegan yet because as a child, we have very little choice on what we eat since our parents are the ones doing the shopping and are blinded by the cost of consuming animal products. In fact, nobody really knew what was happening behind the scenes in factory farms and believed the animals were given a happy life with no sense of suffering.\n\n1. Suffering of animals.\n2. Environmental concerns.\n\n## Leaving my family made it easier\nWhen I joined the Navy, veganism wasn't on my mind at first because my first 4 years there were pretty rough, and it wasn't until I transitioned into a military linguist and studied at the Defense Language Institute where I discovered that they had a vegan options at the mess hall. I would eat black bean burger, salad, peanut butter sandwich and would feel great about being vegan.

The project I cloned was a task management system called Asana. I picked this app because it was the program I used when I was working at my previous job and wanted to show it to my boss when I get it presentable.\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\nThe technologies I used in creating this app was React/JS to render the visuals, Express/JS with Sequelize for the backend, but this time in two seperate servers with proxies. To make my project styling consistent, I used a library called Material-UI. It is the most popular React UI framework at the time and the documentation has a lot of great snippets and examples.\r\nOne of the problems I faced was pretty hard to swallow because it’s something I’ve been before without realizing it. I wanted to make two different components render the same message when either was changed.\r\n\r\nTime felt a lot faster and it seemed like there was more work to do compared to while I was working in a group. Also more draining because progress is much slower.\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to go search for the solution for the answer, but I just couldn’t find it.\r\nThe one action I took to solve this problem was very simple. I just posted my code snippet on slack and asked for suggestions.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to ask for questions, because someone can have an answer.\r\n\r\nEven though it’s a solo project, asking help and suggestions is still highly advised and that’s what I did.\r\n\r\nWorking solo adds a lot of stress and makes it hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\r\nAfter solving that, I realized that the problem goes beyond lack of understanding, but the mental fog that builds up when working for too long so I learned something new from it.\r\n\r\nI still feel proud of my solo project just for the fact that I was the key creator in this app and took ownership of it.\r\n\r\nIn my future solo project, I managed to create a better system by using React Context instead of passing down props.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Learning the importance of debugging\r\nBring up the chrome inspector, use debugger/ break points.\r\n\r\nI've used Chrome extensions to further enhacing my debugging capabilities in production mode by adding Redux Devtools. This made it easier for me to view Redux state without having the print to the console. Cross Origin Resource Sharing was a problem I had earlier when seperating my front end from the backend, and it was solved easily by adding the CORS middleware to the backend. Aside from using Chrome inspector, I also use Postman to test API calls.\r\n\r\nError checking and displaying them is vital for full stack applications since it is difficult to spot backend errors due to having little to no visual cues and the asynchronous unpredictability of network connections. I think it takes a lot of manual work to figure out if the API error is a frontend or backend error. By using the debugger and stepping in and out of the processes. If this doesn't work, then I would try debugging again with parameters I know would succeed to try to understand why this one works and the other one doesn't. 404 errors while fetching from an API usually means for me that I've sent it to the wrong URL and my frontend routing incorrect. If I get a 422 error unprocessible entity, that could be that I'm not passing in correct parameters from the frontend to the backend so I have to make sure what I'm passing in is what the backend is willing to accept. On the other hand, if I know what I'm sending the backend is 100% accurate, then a 422 error would mean that messed up on proccessing the data in the backend deals with the database, whether it be creating entries, joining models, relationships, querying the wrong entries, etc.\r\n\r\nThe frontend also has its challenges. Solving visual errors relies on my creative thinking and searching for hints online since they're usually not spotted by the compiler unless it's a common error such as a reference or syntax error. I think state management is one of the tougher things to debug depending on how much components are dependant on it.If there are any problems with state management, I would probably solve it by stepping through the debugger and trying to find out where the error might occur.\r\n\r\nError checking and displaying them is something I try to do when I'm working on full stack applications. It is difficult to spot fetch requests or state errors due to having asynchronous nature and little to no visual cues. I have used the browser inspectors has helped me deal with a lot of bugs I have solved. I also use Chrome extensions in production mode to further enhancing my debugging capabilities, such as the Redux Devtools. This made it easier for me to view Redux state without having the print to the console. Cross Origin Resource Sharing was a problem I had earlier when separating my front end from the backend, and it was solved easily by adding the CORS middleware to the backend. Aside from using Chrome inspector, I also use Postman to test our authentication, authorization, API requests other than GET etc.\r\n\r\nThe debugger has helped me a lot, I fixed 422 unprocessable entities and props/ state errors by stepping in and out of the processes. I would try this with my original data, and later with parameters I know would succeed, just to get an idea of why this one works and the other one doesn't. I figured out that 404 errors happen while fetching from the wrong API URL so I messed up in my routing somewhere. If I get a 422 error unprocessable enty, that could be that I'm not passing in correct parameters from the frontend to the backend so I have to make sure what I'm passing in is what the backend is willing to accept.

It\r\n\r\nI understand why every job interview asks about a failure that happened on the job. It's okay for a novice to make mistakes, it can even be beneficial so they'll adapt. Painful experiences are a way to get  just like rats being afraid of something to avoid an electric shock. No pain no gain. (Talk about how I failed at salesforce.) I've been rejected by so many jobs and weren't phased by it, so why this one? I'm still trying to understand that myself.\r\n\r\nLife would be incredibly boring if all we do is win, just imagine playing a game and there's no challenge. Its working towards the finish line and conquering hurdles.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nI'm someone who isn't afraid to ask for help.\r\n\r\nWhile I was studying at the Defense Language Instiute, our Military Language\r\n\r\nwhat is the hardest word for us to say in the language to sa\r\n\r\nI also respect people's time, so before I ask for help, I make sure to give my mentors some clues on my problems so we can figure out a solution faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep things serious and professional.\r\n\r\nBusiness and everything done has consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf learning is bland.\r\n\r\nTough is okay,\r\n\r\nsometimes it's the desire that keeps you\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been times where I am\r\n\r\n\r\nTime I failed,\r\n\r\nmillions of times.\r\n\r\nI've probably fail\r\n\r\nbut it depends on the situation where I failed that matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckily none of it resulted in a huge disaster.\r\n\r\nGotta train train train train until it's perfect and that's what I got to keep doing even though it's impossible to\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\nA lot of good quotes while I was in the navy.\r\n\r\nI might've mentioned that in my application for Journeyage.\r\n\r\nOnce you learn something, you being to love it.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to perfection, we should still strive for it.

Everyone started fighting for it. Shore duty vs ship duty.\r\n\r\nI do admit that it beats being yelled at by the maintenance officer when we don't finish our tasks, but he did have a good point. We all should be happy that we get paid extra money everyday for cost of living, get to explore a nice city and sleep at a 4 star hotel. Subconcious.\r\n\r\nI then put that same mentality on the ship duty folks except this time comparing it to other crewmates whose lives are 10x worse than ours.\r\n\r\nEveryone hated ship duty, until I started acting happy working on the ship and enjoying life there.\r\nAnd it's actually pretty miserable.
