I have taken multiple roles as a programmer, level, and UI/ UX designer using my C# knowledge and Unity3D design skills to deliver 2 mobile apps to the Android and iOS stores, several weeks ahead of schedule.","Despite not being formally trained in computer science and software engineering, I enjoyed the struggles I faced and wanted to push my software development skills even further so I went to study full stack web development at App Academy. This coding bootcamp required full time commitment, so I resigned from ESC-Toy to pursue this path. During my time at App Academy, I have done thousands of hours of intense coding practice, created 4 full stack projects using various programming languages and technologies such HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React and Redux. I've also done automated testing using Mocha, using test, and behavioral driven development.","So this brings us to where I am now. I have graduated from App Academy and now work part time at a company called Merakis Group. This was my first position as a super developer and had to pick up the Dart language and Flutter framework. I fell in love with Dart and Flutter because of how much dopamine I would get for blazing through tutorials. It's all thanks to App Academy giving me an excellent foundation of how to learn quickly. I collaborate remotely with 4 other people, have a couple of weekly standups, updating the team on my progress, discussing blockers, and sharing my thoughts. I've also had to learn how to use Amazon Web Services within our project. I've set up AWS Cognito for User Authentication and Simple Storage System (S3) for storing images and have used a bit of DynamoDB for GraphQL API endpoints in addition to AppSync and Datastore to set up Serverless.","I feel well-suited working in tech and communicating with people. Not only that, but I am extremely enthusiastic and because I get immense job satisfaction from programming. I get to see first hand the positive contribution my work makes."]},header:{backgroundSrc:"images/headers/krisna-sarith-portfolio-header.png"},projects:{enabled:e},blog:{enabled:e},resume:{enabled:e,pdfUrl:"/krisna-sarith_resume.pdf"},contact:{enabled:e},technologies:{enabled:e,meta:[{title:"HTML/ CSS",image1:"images/logos/html5-logo.png",image2:"images/logos/css3-logo.png",value:"Build sites with pure HTML and CSS.Create styling within the HTML itself.Style elements by adding classes, ids, hovers, media queries with CSS.This site was built with HTML and CSS."},{title:"JavaScript/ TypeScript",image1:"images/logos/javascript-logo.png",image2:"images/logos/typescript-logo.png",value:"Can manipulate DOM elements with vanilla JavaScript.
