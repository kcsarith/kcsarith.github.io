					<p>After I got out of the United State's Navy, I earned a Bachelors of Science in Game
						Art and Design from the
						Art Institute of Las Vegas and had a very delightful time working as a Game Developer for
						ESC-Toy ltd. I have taken
						multiple roles as a programmer, level, and UI/ UX designer using my C# knowledge and Unity3D
						design skills to deliver 2
						mobile apps to the Android and iOS stores, several weeks ahead of schedule.</p>

					<p>Despite not being formally trained in computer science and software engineering, I enjoyed the
						struggles I faced and
						wanted to push my software development skills even further so I went to study full stack web
						development at App Academy.
						This coding bootcamp required full time commitment, so I resigned from ESC-Toy to pursue this
						path. During my time at
						App Academy, I have done thousands of hours of intense coding practice, created 4 full stack
						projects using various
						programming languages and technologies such HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Python, Flask,
						PostgreSQL, React and Redux.
						I've also done automated testing using Mocha, using test, and behavioral driven development.</p>

					<p>So this brings us to where I am now. I have graduated from App Academy and now work part time at
						a company called
						Merakis Group. This was my first position as a super developer and had to pick up the Dart
						language and Flutter
						framework. I fell in love with Dart and Flutter because of how much dopamine I would get for
						blazing through tutorials.
						It's all thanks to App Academy giving me an excellent foundation of how to learn quickly. I
						collaborate remotely with 4
						other people, have a couple of weekly standups, updating the team on my progress, discussing
						blockers, and sharing my
						thoughts. I've also had to learn how to use Amazon Web Services within our project. I've set up
						AWS Cognito for User
						Authentication and Simple Storage System (S3) for storing images and have used a bit of DynamoDB
						for GraphQL API
						endpoints in addition to AppSync and Datastore to set up Serverless.</p>

					<p>I feel well-suited working in tech and communicating with people. Not only that, but I am
						extremely enthusiastic and because I get immense job satisfaction from programming. I get to see
						first hand the positive contribution my work makes.</p>
