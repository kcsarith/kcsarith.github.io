# About Me
My name is Krisna Sarith, a full stack developer. I have had interest in software engineering ever since I was in middle school and my curiosity only increases the more I learn about it. I started programming without the need of writing scripts up until High School and moved onto using real programming languages beyond. C# was a programming language I used to create games, and there are even a couple of mobile apps I've published while I was working at ESC-Toy. During the pandemic, I decided to push my software engineering skills even further and acquired knowledge about full stack development where I created 4 applications using JavaScript, Python, or both.
# Tools of the Trade
Below are a list of programming languages I have experience and skills I can perform.
## Programming Languages
Learning one language makes it easier to learn another, because the foundations of each computer language share similarities in that they have functions, variables but with specialized vocabulary. Below are a list of programming languages I've created products along with some of the packages or frameworks I've used from them.
### JavaScript
This was the most popular language at the time I learned it. It has a lot of resources and can be a good standalone language to create web apps because of React.js
1. Node.js
2. Vanilla js
3. Express.js
4. React.js
5. Redux
6. Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL

### Python3
Second most popular programming language happens to be Python, and it can do so much. This is a language I primary use for the back-end, but really like the way Python can do list and dicitonary comprehensions in one line. When I create more complicated software, I will want to use more Python3.
1. Flask
2. SQL Alchemy ORM for PostgreSQL
### C#
In terms of programming languages for creating games, this language probably has the most resources to learn and it is quite similar to JavaScript.
1. Monodevelop
## Skills
- Designing user interfaces and front end components with React, CSS/ Component Libraries, or HTML.
- Connecting front-end logic with React Hooks to manage a component's state, Context to share states between other components, and Redux to change the store.
- Implementing Authentication and Authorization with hashed passwords and getting the user from JSON Web Tokens.
- Creating seperate routes to make fetch calls to the API back-end to manipulate the database.
- Deploying on Heroku with dockerfiles.
