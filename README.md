## Programming Languages
Learning one language makes it easier to learn another, because the foundations of each computer language share similarities in that they have functions, variables but with specialized vocabulary. Below are a list of programming languages I've created products along with some of the packages or frameworks I've used from them.
### JavaScript
1. Vanilla js dom manipulation
2. Express.js
3. React.js
4. Redux
5. Node
6. Sequelize ORM for PostgreSQL

### Python
1. Flask
2. SQL Alchemy ORM for PostgreSQL
### C#
1. Monodevelop
## Skills
- Designing user interfaces and front end components with React, CSS/ Component Libraries, or HTML.
- Connecting front-end logic with React Hooks to manage a component's state, Context to share states between other components, and Redux to change the store.
- Implementing Authentication and Authorization with hashed passwords and getting the user from JSON Web Tokens.
- Creating seperate routes to make fetch calls to the API back-end to manipulate the database.
- Deploying on Heroku with dockerfiles.
